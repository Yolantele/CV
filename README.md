## Jolanta Jasiulion

I am an aspiring full stack Ruby developer currently undergoing training at Makers Academy, London.  
I’m striving to learn the best coding and development practices to produce sustainable, adaptable code and programs.

Thus far I had 5 years of experience within product design (non-digital) and have been privileged to work on global programs within the tightly knit team, delivering to high-expectations. Some if the global programs I had the opportunity to work on, had been reported to had exceeded the performance expectations.  While I consider myself fortunate to share these points, I do attribute any of the past successes to the correct working practices and ethics and a level of focused commitment and enthusiasm, all of which will hopefully continue to bring the good fortune in the future.

I am looking for the opportunity to use the programming skills and continue the practice of good design in the environment that aligns with these values.



## Skills


#### Creative Problem-solving 

I firmly believe that there is more than one way to solve a problem at hand -  an opportunity for a creative solution which adds to the value, unlike if there was no problem at first place. 
I relied on problem-solving skills for developing product designs that meet tight safety regulations, low-cost manufacturing methods, and promotional market inherent time constrains. Delivering some of the most successful programs was a true testament to fitness in problem solving.  
I continue on growing this skill since the early days at young physicits school and events that laid the foundations for resourcefulness and problem-solving .


####  Sound Communication

English is my second language, it taught me the value of learning a language well and more importantly,  the value of sound communication in the context of both the team-work and project execution. 
An example inside the context of project execution , communication skills  translated in the form of sound design: product and presentations had to communicate the promise of the program to clients and licensors,  in the clearest possible manner as well be understood very Cleary by the manufacturers in far East: for the successful execution of multi-million product quantities. 
An example inside the context of team-work, was guiding a junior with anxiety disorder. It placed huge reliance on my communication skills :  effective, considered and informed, I had to  guide her to stay productive without triggering any anxiety attacks, she occasionally suffered from at work. In the end her most proud work was produced on the 2 McDonald’s Premiums programs we worked on together . 
I hope to translate this skill into developing eloquent, well designed code, programs and future projects.


#### Positive Attitude (:]

When it comes to the glass of water question - it is half full, in my eyes. I find that a healthy amount of enthusiasm and joy has only served me thus far in career and personal life. In addition to that, I see a considerable amount of value in practicing mindfulness and stress-relief techniques as tools to aid my high-performance goals such as completing an olympic distance Triathlon or becoming a successfull full-stack web developer.
