#### Creative Problem-solving

I enjoy problem-solving and see it as a creative process. I rely on these skills for developing  products that have to satisfy varied demands: GDPR  regulations, rapid prototyping for tight deadlines, taking into account possibilites for changes led by client requests.  I value approaching large problems in small-sized steps.


####  Sound Communication

I value and strive to bring good quality communication in whichever context it appears: writing sound code or team-work ethics.
An example within team-work, would be the time I mentored a junior with anxiety disorder. It placed huge reliance on my communication skills: clear yet considerate of triggering anxiety attacks she occasionally suffered from at work. I was acknowledged for guiding her through her best on several programs we worked on. I hope to continue to bring high-value with this skill.


#### High-performance Attitude

I find that a healthy amount of enthusiasm and joy has only served me thus far in maintaining high quality productivity. Mindfulness and stress-relief techniques served as tools to aid my high-performance goals. I attribute some successes to this,  such as completing olympic-distance Triathlon and also becoming the develper I am today.
