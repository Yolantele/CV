I am a recent graduate from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), a 16 week coding bootcamp. I am in a continuous process of learning the best coding and development practices to produce sustainable, adaptable, well crafted code. I look forward to joining a team where I could continue learning and practice good craftsmanship. Please find the most recent projects I was involved:

[Database Visualiser app](https://github.com/Yolantele/Database-visualization)


[AirBnB Clone](https://github.com/Yolantele/MakersBnB)

I also have a (fairly) newbie [dev-blog](https://medium.com/@klpdjolanta) on Medium.

Prior to Makers Academy I had 5 years of experience within product design (non-digital) and have been privileged to work on and lead some of the most successful global programs for the largest toy distributor in the world - McDonalds, within the tightly knit team. I attribute my past successes to some key skills outlined in the next section.




## Skills


#### Creative Problem-solving

I enjoy problem-solving and see it as a creative process. In the past, I relied on these skills for developing promotional products that had to satisfy many constraints: extensive safety regulations, low-cost per unit, restricted mass-manufacturing methods, tight deadlines among having to drive sales-boosts for Mcdonald's Worldwide.  I started developing problem-solving techniques since the early days at young physicists school,  where I learned the value of approaching large problems in small-sized steps.


####  Sound Communication

I value and strive to bring good quality communication in whichever context it appears: coding or team-work.
An example inside the context of team-work, would be the time I mentored a junior product designer with anxiety disorder. It placed huge reliance on my communication skills: I had to be clear yet considerate of triggering anxiety attacks, that she occasionally experienced at work. In the end her most proud work was produced on the two McDonald’s Happy Meal programs we worked on together under my lead. I hope to continue to bring high-value with this skill.


#### High-performance Attitude

I find that a healthy amount of enthusiasm and joy has only served me thus far in maintaining high quality productivity. In addition to that, I see a considerable amount of value in practicing mindfulness and stress-relief techniques as tools to aid my high-performance goals. I attribute some successes to this,  such as completing olympic-distance Triathlon and also becoming a junior developer at Makers Academy :]
