## Jolanta Jasiulion

I am an aspiring full stack Ruby developer currently undergoing training at Makers Academy, London.  I’m striving to learn the best coding and development practices to produce sustainable, adaptable code and programs.  

I have thus far had 5 years of experience within product design (non-digital) and been privileged to work on global programs within the tightly knit team, delivering to high-expectations. While I consider myself fortunate to share these point about me, I do attribute any of the past successes to the correct working practices and ethics and a level of focused commitment, that will hopefully continue to bring the good fortune in the future.

 I am looking for the opportunity to use the programming skills and continue the practice of good design in the environment that aligns with these values.


## Skills

#### Creative Problem-solving 

I firmly believe that there is more than one way to solve a problem at hand -  an opportunity for a creative solution which adds to the value, unlike if there was no problem at first place. 
I relied on problem-solving skills for product designs,  McDonalds global: developing designs to tight safety regulations, manufacturing methods, low cost, and time resource. Delivering some of the most successful programs was a true testament to that.  I continue on growing this skill since the days at young physics Olympics events.  

####  Sound Communication

English is my second language, developed over 10 years. It taught me the value learning a language well, but perhaps more importantly,  the value of sound communication:  wether it was  in the way of putting together and delivering a successful product presentation, clear instructions to yoga class students, working closely with team members, or writing a piece of script - I place high value on sound and eloquent communication.

#### Positive Attitude

When it comes to the glass of water question - it is rather half full, in my eyes. I find that a healthy amount of enthusiasm and joy has only served me thus far both in career and personal life. In addition, I see a considerable amount of value in practicing mindfulness and stress-relief techniques as tools to reach my high-performance goals such as completing an olympic distance Triathlon or becoming junior full-stack Wed Developer.
