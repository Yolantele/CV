## Jolanta Jas

I am in continuous process of learning the best coding and development practices to produce sustainable, adaptable, well designed code and programs.

Thus far I had 5 years of experience within product design (non-digital) and have been privileged to work on global programs within the tightly knit team, delivering to high-expectations. Some of the global programs I had the opportunity to work on, had been reported to exceed the performance expectations.  While I consider myself fortunate to share these points, I do attribute any of the past successes to my working practices, a level of focused commitment and enthusiasm.

I am looking for the opportunity to use the programming skills and continue the practice of good design in the environment that aligns with these values



## Skills


#### Creative Problem-solving

I firmly believe that there is more than one way to solve a problem at hand -  an opportunity for a creative solution which adds to the value.
I relied on problem-solving skills for developing product prototypes that meet tight safety regulations, low-costs, restricted manufacturing methods, and promotional product time constrains.  I continue on growing this skill since the early days at young physicists school and events that laid the foundations for approaching seemingly too great a problem in small bites.


####  Sound Communication

I place huge value good quality communication, in which ever context it may appear: coding or collaboration.
An example inside the context of team-work, was guiding a junior with anxiety disorder. It placed huge reliance on my communication skills. I had to be clear yet considerate of triggering anxiety attacks, she occasionally suffered from at work. In the end her most proud work was produced on the 2 McDonald’s Happy Meal programs we worked on together.
I hope to translate this skill into developing eloquent, well designed code, programs and future projects.


#### High-performance Attitude

I find that a healthy amount of enthusiasm and joy has only served me thus far in maintaining high quality productivity. In addition to that, I see a considerable amount of value in practicing mindfulness and stress-relief techniques as tools to aid my high-performance goals such as completing an olympic distance Triathlon or becoming a successful full-stack web developer through Makers Academy.
