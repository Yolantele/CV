## Jolanta Jas

I am in a continuous process of learning the best coding and development practices to produce sustainable, adaptable, well designed code and programs.
Please find projects I was most recently involved in most:
- Foodeals app - https://github.com/Yolantele/foodie
- Database agnostic Visualiser app - https://github.com/Yolantele/Database-visualization

Thus far I had 5 years of experience within product design (non-digital) and have been privileged to work on global programs within the tightly knit team, delivering to high-expectations. Some of the global programs I had the opportunity to work on, had been reported to exceed the performance expectations.  While I consider myself fortunate to share these points, I do attribute any of the past successes to my working practices, a level of focused commitment and enthusiasm.

I am looking for the opportunity to use the programming skills and continue the practice of good design in the environment that aligns with these values



## Skills


#### Creative Problem-solving

I believe a problem at hand can be an opportunity for creative solution that adds adds to the value of product.
In the past, I relied on these skills for developing product prototypes that meet tight safety regulations, low-costs, restricted manufacturing methods and promotional product time constrains.  I continue on growing this skill since the early days at young physicists school where the foundations for approaching seemingly large problem in small bites.


####  Sound Communication

I place huge value on good quality communication in which ever context it appears: coding or collaborating.
An example inside the context of team-work, would be mentoring a junior product designer with anxiety disorder. It placed huge reliance on my communication skills. I had to be clear yet considerate of triggering anxiety attacks, that she occasionally suffered from at work. In the end her most proud work was produced on the two McDonald’s Happy Meal programs we worked on together under my lead.I hope to translate this skill into developing eloquent, well designed code, programs and future projects.


#### High-performance Attitude

I find that a healthy amount of enthusiasm and joy has only served me thus far in maintaining high quality productivity. In addition to that, I see a considerable amount of value in practicing mindfulness and stress-relief techniques as tools to aid my high-performance goals such as completing olympic distance Triathlon or becoming a full-stack web developer through Makers Academy.
